This is a practice file to work on pushing to GitHub through RStudio desktop.  To practice this, we will set this file up by using the regular code:

```{r}
# use code to clear the environment window and import the appropriate libraries to access their functions
rm(list = ls())
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Upon initially committing the file, it appears that it worked and the changes are reflected in GitHub.  Now I will push the file with the text changes outlined in this paragraph to practice pushing again.
